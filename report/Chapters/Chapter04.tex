\chapter{A basic Tensorflow model}\label{ch:basic_tf_model}
%*****************************************

In this chapter we will discover a basic Tensorflow model developed in order to classify images from the MNIST dataset. Our scope is to illustrate the structure of a \acsp{CNN} and how that basic model can be readjust as needed, gathering data about training accuracy during the epochs and test accuracy on known and unknown images from the dataset.

After an introduction to the MNIST dataset, we will study in deep the structure of the Convolutional Neural Network used in our experiments, trying to understand which parameters are relevant to the improvement of the results, and how the structure can influence most of all on the accuracy of the network during the training.
