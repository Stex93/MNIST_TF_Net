\chapter*{Abstract}
\acp{DNN} are becoming a central topic in machine learning research. They can be used for a large amount of complex tasks, including automatic speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, but also toxicology, bioinformatics, and neuroscience. In these contexts, many different frameworks for deep learning have been released; among them Google's TensorFlow provides a complete and well documented toolbox for programming \acp{DNN}.

The aim of this report is to analyze a widely used kind of deep architecture, the Convolutional Neural Network, as well as briefly introduce the TensorFlow framework. In the second part a simple model for the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits built with TensorFlow is presented and some conclusions about the architecture of the network are drawn.
